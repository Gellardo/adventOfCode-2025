Part 1 was straight forward breadth-first Search.
Part 2, again, I wanted to reuse the algorithm and came up with a "simple" hashing algo to be able to keep using the same map approach.
But I think I messed up when trying to get the hashing to work with the toggles, so I'll restart from the beginning for part 2.
