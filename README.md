# Advent of Code 2025

Just want to get things done...
So I'm using Python and don't care for easy to read / maintainable / reusable / fast code.

Perhaps I will later make a run through to refactor and improve the code... but no promises.

Possible extension points for me, after everything is finished
- build a visualizer for day 8 (the minimum spanning tree one) or day 11
- build a proper solver for day 10 part 2 instead of using z3
- use ai assistance to find good algorithms for day 9 part 2 and day 12 part 1.
